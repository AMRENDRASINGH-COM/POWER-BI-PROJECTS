🚀 Power BI MovieLens Dashboard: Unlocking Insights from Movie Ratings! 🎬📊

I recently worked on an interactive Power BI dashboard using the MovieLens dataset, analyzing user ratings, genres, and demographic trends. This dashboard provides deep insights into how different age groups, occupations, and decades influence movie preferences and ratings.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ User Demographics Analysis – Breakdown of male and female users across age groups and occupations.
✅ Genre Popularity – Total movies analyzed by genre and occupation.
✅ Rating Trends – Average ratings across decades and user demographics.
✅ Geographical Distribution – Mapping total users worldwide.

💡 Insights Discovered:
📌 Drama, Comedy, and Horror dominate the movie landscape in terms of volume.
📌 Ratings vary significantly by occupation, with retired users having the highest average ratings.
📌 Older movies (before 1980) tend to have higher average ratings compared to newer releases.
